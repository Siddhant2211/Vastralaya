## Getting started

To set up the Vastralaya Ecommerce Application, follow these steps carefully:

### 1. Install npm Dependencies

First, install the required npm dependencies by running the following command in your terminal depend with package you are using:

```bash
npm install
or
yarn install
or
pnpm install
```

This will download all the necessary packages listed in package.json.

## 2. Create a New Sanity Project

Set up a Sanity project to manage your ecommerce content (e.g., products or blog posts):

```bash
npm create sanity@latest -- --env=.env.local --create-project "Vastralaya ecommerce" --dataset production
```

If you donâ€™t have a Sanity account, this command will guide you to create one.
When prompted with "Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder?", select "n" (no), as the --env=.env.local flag handles this automatically.
After running this command, a .env.local file will be created (or updated) in your project root with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID: A unique ID for your Sanity project, generated during this step.
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET: Set to production.

- Note: You can verify your NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID later by logging into https://www.sanity.io/manage, selecting the "Vastralaya ecommerce" project, and checking the project details.

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The application requires additional environment variables beyond those set in Step 2. Edit your .env file in the project root to include the following:

```bash

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<already-set-by-step-2>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-11-09
SANITY_API_TOKEN=<your-sanity-api-token>
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=<your-sanity-api-read-token>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-clerk-secret-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
SENDBIRD_APP_ID=<your-sendbird-app-id>

```
